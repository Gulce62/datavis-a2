Question 1: Describe the main principle of a scatterplot matrix!

A scatterplot matrix (SPLOM) is a grid-based visualization that displays pairwise relationships between multiple numerical attributes in a dataset. Each row and column corresponds to one attribute, and every cell in the matrix contains a scatterplot comparing the two associated attributes. In this way, a SPLOM decomposes a multivariate dataset into all possible two-dimensional projections, making it easier to visually compare variables, detect trends, correlations, clusters, and outliers.

Question 2: How many scatterplots for n attributes?

(n^2 - n) / 2 

Total possible pairs: n^2
Remove diagonal: n comparisons of attribute with itself
Divide by 2 because the matrix is symmetric (A vs B equals B vs A)

Question 3: Sketch an example for the cars data set (with 3 selected cars)

The sketch can be found in photos/sketch.png file.

Question 4:  Discuss advantages and disadvantages

Advantages
* Correlation: Shows all pairwise relationships between attributes at once.
* Comparison: Each attribute can be compared visually against every other attribute.
* Pattern recognition: Useful for detecting structural patterns and inconsistencies in the data.

Disadvantages
* Scalability issues: Does not scale well to high-dimensional datasets as the matrix becomes very large.
* Overplotting: Scatterplots can become dense making exploration of data harder.
* Limited to pairwise relations: It can only examine pair-wise relationships and cannot capture higher-order interactions between variables.
